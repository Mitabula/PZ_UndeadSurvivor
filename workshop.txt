description=The Stalker is geared for getting in close combat and situations where you have to be light and agile. If you are lucky and find his knife, then you cannot be better prepared for any melee encounter. Only downside is that due to its lightweight tailoring, the outfit does not withstand very cold and rainy weather.

description=The Nomad has the perfect outfit to hike through the lone wilderness in the cold and rainy weather. They aren't fighters; their outfit will slow you down and doesn't have the best protection against the dead, but if you are lucky, you can spot one with a backpack which can hold all your equipment if you are strong enough to carry it.

description=The Prepper, aka. Gear-junkie, isn't best suited for infectious bites. His strategy is to keep death 10 feet away. To make sure he doesn't run out of ammo, he's equipped with gun magazine pouches and small, but efficient bags which can be mounted to the vest as some sort of backpack. If the walking dead gets too close, he has a small knife attached to his vest and can retrieve it by a quick hand, in addition to a flashlight.

description=Like a stoic stone from a distance, the Headhunter observes and waits for his victims to appear. His gasmask and long mantle covers him from hazard rains and the storm while doing so.
description=The customized rifle is heavy and slow, but a deadly and reliable weapon with 20 bullets and a range you haven't seen before. No victim can escape once spotted.

description=A team of women who retain their beauty in dark times and still strong enough to survive. Their self-made clothing can be deceiving; a dress and cloak made of thick fabric and fur gives good protection from bites and keeps them warm. In addition, they also have a hip bag that keeps them light and flexible. Their spear is an effective weapon and tool for hunting or fishing.
